      <p>Today I lifted weights in the morning. I had mixed feelings because I
      felt good getting back into my morning gym routine but frustrated because
        my form was still nagging me. No matter.</p>
      <p>Work today was productive, but I felt more resistance than I did
        yesterday. Maybe the euphoria of working from home is wearing off. I hope
        I can keep up my focus for the coming weeks. That would be disappointing
        if I had to admit to myself I couldn't focus at home, despite my best
        efforts at maintaining a routine and dressing up for work.</p>
      <p>After work I DoorDashed for a bit before making a Costco run. I did
        good. Despite dashing for only 1.25 hours and making only 3 deliveries,
        I made more money tonight than I did on any of my other nights. Bless
        you customers who tipped me so generously! I don't deserve it, but you
        gave me the benefit of the doubt regardless. Other thoughts: traffic was
        really light on the streets, which was extra nice. It's rare I get to
        drive around town in the evening twilight in such peace. I think I'll do
        more DoorDashing in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>I went to Costco to pick up some eggs and salted butter. I came home
        with a whole cartload of food for the coming weeks. Come on now, I was
        buying for my brother too! On a similar note to my DoorDash story, it was
        also incredibly empty at the Costco, emptier than on regular
        weekdays. What a treat!</p>

      <p>This article is a work in progress. It sucks because I'm just using it
        as dumping ground for my stream of consciousness so I don't lose those
        memories when my brain garbage collects. Not that my polished work is
        any good to begin with, but you catch my drift, yeah? When I have the
        content written out, I will remove this notice. Cheers!</p>
