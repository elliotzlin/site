      <p>Today I lifted weights in the morning. I had mixed feelings because I
      felt good getting back into my morning gym routine but frustrated because
        my form was still nagging me. No matter.</p>
      <p>Work today was productive, but I felt more resistance than I did
        yesterday. Maybe the euphoria of working from home is wearing off. I hope
        I can keep up my focus for the coming weeks. That would be disappointing
        if I had to admit to myself I couldn't focus at home, despite my best
        efforts at maintaining a routine and dressing up for work.</p>
      <p>After work I DoorDashed for a bit before making a Costco run. I did
        good. Despite dashing for only 1.25 hours and making only 3 deliveries,
        I made more money tonight than I did on any of my other nights. Bless
        you customers who tipped me so generously! I don't deserve it, but you
        gave me the benefit of the doubt regardless. Other thoughts: traffic was
        really light on the streets, which was extra nice. It's rare I get to
        drive around town in the evening twilight in such peace. I think I'll do
        more DoorDashing in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>I went to Costco to pick up some eggs and salted butter. I came home
        with a whole cartload of food for the coming weeks. Come on now, I was
        buying for my brother too! On a similar note to my DoorDash story, it was
        also incredibly empty at the Costco, emptier than on regular
        weekdays. What a treat!</p>

      <h3>2020年 3月 31日</h3>
      <p>We have a little over a week until April 7, the final day of our
        shelter-in-place order. However there was already talk of extending it
        to May 1. Trump himself had recommended over the weekend and the 6 Bay
        Area counties were preparing to make their announcement.</p>
      <p>Later on we find out that it's actually extended to May 3. That it was
        extended past April 7 surprised none of us. Personally, I was holding
        out some hope that it wouldn't go past May 3, but I'm still not willing
        to put money on that.</p>
      <p>None of this mattered much to me at the moment because I was working
        hard on getting a web release out. We had a sort of self-imposed
        deadline of April 1 and we were working our tail ends off to push as
        many features as we could by then. The three of us, my boss, a coworker,
        and I worked until about 12:30am, with all communications over a Zoom
        call. Afterwards my coworker signed off -- he was on the East Coast
        after all and was up criminally late -- and my boss and I sallied forth
        before calling it a day at 4:30am.</p>
      <p>It was about the most fun I've had since the first couple of days of
        shelter-in-place.</p>

      <h3>2020年 4月 1日</h3>
      <p>I had an incredible itch to scratch this day. After burning the
        midnight oil several nights in a row, my boss deemd it fitting to give
        me and my aforementioned coworker the day off to rest. He probably
        needed it more than I did but I gladly took my share of the credit.</p>
      <p>At around that time I was getting hooked on watching cooking shows on
        TV and on the Internet and fantasized building my home kitchen. I
        couldn't resist it. Then I was a college student with no income -- I did
        have an allowance, but I would've felt guilt spending that money on
        anything other than the bare essentials, in my case rent, food, and
        tuition. Now I had decent money, and I was still employed amidst this
        coronavirus scare.</p>
      <p>Instead of resting, I dashed out of the house to pick up some more
        food. Might as well stock up some more while I had time off on a weekday
        so I could comfortably ride out my self-imposed quarantine until May
        3. After 3 hours running about town, I came home with my modest
        (compared to the other shoppers I saw) haul, which included a 25 lb sack
        of "H&R" All-Purpose Flour. H&R stands for "Hotel and Restaurant". What
        else would you expect from Costco? Apparently it was no different from
        regular all-purpose flour you'd find in a grocery store. It was just
        marketed towards commercial use. I can just pretend I'm a home cook with
        a large-scale operation. I'll wear that proudly.</p>
      <p>One interesting tidbit I gleaned from these times is Amazon can't be
        relied upon for a fair amount of items. You were better off driving to a
        brick-and-mortar store if you wanted to pick up water bottles or toilet
        paper than you were trying to order off Amazon. You could forget about
        ordering groceries off of Amazon Fresh because there were no delivery
        times available. And darn it, all the instant dry yeast online was
        marked up at least 100%. In the middle of my cooking reverie I bought a
        stand mixer and a Dutch oven. I had to purhcase both from their
        respective manufacturers' websites because they were out of stock on
        Amazon. Did I over-exaggerate my claim at the beginning of this
        paragraph? Yes. But in truth you could really see Amazon buckling under
        all this pressure.</p>

      <h3>2020年 4月 4日</h3>
      <p>Today I made pasta the right way. Granted it was only spaghetti with
        some marinara sauce. But still, this time around I followed the best
        practices I could find on the Internet as closely as I could manage. I
        heated my sauce beforehand; cooked with tongs so as to more easily
        transfer the pasta noodles (almost losing 2 strands in the process); I
        cooked the pasta with the sauce instead of pouring the sauce over the
        noodles at the end; I properly doused the pasta and sauce with my pasta
        water, instead of simply adding pasta water to my sauce all by itself,
        which gave me sad, water sauce. And what a difference it made!
        <em>Indeed</em> the sauce and pasta had become one. With every bite I
        tasted the wonderfully rich Newman's Own marinara sauce (still working
        up the courage to rolling my own batch) followed by the <em>al dente</em>
        chew of the Barilla spaghetti noodles. And when I had finished with my
        pasta, my plate was actually mostly clean. Okay, perhaps I thickened my
        sauce too much, but still, this was the first time I had seen such a
        stark difference between the right and wrong ways of cooking
        something. My mind was actually blown by this experience.</p>

      <h3>2020年 4月 6日</h3>
      <p>It has been raining <em>cats</em> all weekend. The rain was so heavy I
        spent five minutes staring out my door listening to it. I even recorded
        a little bit of it for posterity.</p>
      <audio src="assets/rain.mp3" controls preload="none"></audio>
      <p>You can really hear the difference between listening to it from your
        front porch vs listening to it from within a sunroom (or any glass
        enclosure).</p>

      <p>This article is a work in progress. It sucks because I'm just using it
        as dumping ground for my stream of consciousness so I don't lose those
        memories when my brain garbage collects. Not that my polished work is
        any good to begin with, but you catch my drift, yeah? When I have the
        content written out, I will remove this notice. Cheers!</p>
