      <p>Day zero of the quarantine.</p>
      <p>At last, as if we wanted it to happen, delighting at its arrival with
        an almost child-like satisfaction, we were to self-quarantine effective
        midnight. It was half past one in the afternoon when my boss and I
        digested the news. Earlier we had discussed the rumors surrounding a
        state-wide lockdown over lunch. In between bites of my frozen chicken
        taquitos from Trader Joe's smothered in harissa I told him about the
        rumors my brother had heard from his girlfriend, who herself had heard
        it from her aunt's friend's wife who knew someone who working in the
        state capital... you get the idea. It wasn't until someone posted a news
        article reporting that six Bay Area counties were preparing to issue a
        "shelter-in-place" order that we realized it was actually happening.</p>
      <p>"What does it say about... the lockdown?" my boss asked me as he walked
        across the room over to my desk, a look of concern on his face.</p>
      <p>I pulled up the news article on one of my monitors, enlarged the text,
        and skimmed the text out loud. There: they were announcing it at 1
        p.m. It was already a quarter past. I opened a new tab and went to our
        county's website. Sure enough the full text of the order was already
        posted.</p>
      <p>"Sorry boss, I don't think we count as "essential business."</p>
      <p>I could almost see a look of sadness wash over his face. How could he
        bear three long weeks without setting foot in his beloved office?</p>

      <h4>A Storm is Coming</h4>
      <p>We had all been thinking about the coronavirus over the past couple of
        weeks. If we hadn't caught this super-flu yet we had certainly
        contracted it in our minds. If people weren't discussing their beefed-up
        hygienic regime they were commenting on light traffic was on the
        streets.</p>
      <p>I don't know who heard it first in the states, but I suspect Asian
        Americans like myself would have caught wind of it before anyone
        else. Chinese New Year was in late January, and many people of Chinese
        descent with family in the old continent flew back to celebrate and
        visit relatives. My own brother was among them, and if it wasn't for the
        fact that I was saving my PTO hours for a trip to Japan I was planning
        to make in April I would have gone with him. Unfortunately for him and
        many others, the coronavirus epidemic was just picking up momentum, and
        soon the other East Asian countries were reporting cases of their own.</p>
      <p>My brother canceled the rest of his trip and flew home early. The talk
        of the town (if it could be called that in late January/early February)
        was the two week incubation period and <em>that</em> was enough to get
        us excited. What was more infuriating was that my brother's company was
        only allotting him one week to work-from-home. What if he started
        showing symptoms the following week?</p>

      <h4>Day Zero</h4>
      <p>It was drizzling as I drove in to work on this Monday morning. Ever
        since Santa Clara County declared its first confirmed case of COVID-19,
        affectionately known as the "coronavirus" among us lay people, or more
        humorously the "beer flu," I had been driving. Normally I took the train
        to work, sharing my seat with 400,000 other riders across the Bay Area.</p>

      <p>This article is a work in progress. I will not amend the date and will pretend as if I wrote this all on March 16. When I have most of the content written out, I will remove this notice. Cheers!</p>
