      <p>Day zero of the quarantine.</p>
      <p>At last, as if we wanted it to happen, delighting at its arrival with
        an almost child-like satisfaction, we were to self-quarantine effective
        midnight. It was half past one in the afternoon when my boss and I
        digested the news. Earlier we had discussed the rumors surrounding a
        state-wide lockdown over lunch. In between bites of my frozen chicken
        taquitos from Trader Joe's smothered in harissa I told him about the
        rumors my brother had heard from his girlfriend, who herself had heard
        it from her aunt's friend's wife who knew someone who working in the
        state capital... you get the idea. It wasn't until someone posted a news
        article reporting that six Bay Area counties were preparing to issue a
        "shelter-in-place" order that we realized it was actually happening.</p>
      <p>"What does it say about... the lockdown?" my boss asked me as he walked
        across the room over to my desk, a look of concern on his face.</p>
      <p>I pulled up the news article on one of my monitors, enlarged the text,
        and skimmed the text out loud. There: they were announcing it at 1
        p.m. It was already a quarter past. I opened a new tab and went to our
        county's website. Sure enough the full text of the order was already
        posted.</p>
      <p>"Yeah I think we have to stay home now. I don't think we count as
        "essential business."</p>
      <p>As I read that I could almost see a look of sadness wash over his
        face. How could he bear three long weeks without setting foot in his
        beloved office?</p>

      <h4>A Storm is Coming</h4>
      <p>We had all been thinking about the coronavirus over the past couple of
        weeks. If we hadn't caught this super-flu yet we had certainly
        contracted it in our minds. If people weren't discussing their beefed-up
        hygienic regime they were commenting on light traffic was on the
        streets.</p>
      <p>I don't know who heard it first in the states, but I suspect Asian
        Americans like myself would have caught wind of it before anyone
        else. Chinese New Year was in late January, and many people of Chinese
        descent with family in the old continent flew back to celebrate and
        visit relatives. My own brother was among them, and if it wasn't for the
        fact that I was saving my PTO hours for a trip to Japan I was planning
        to make in April I would have gone with him. Unfortunately for him and
        many others, the coronavirus epidemic was just picking up momentum, and
        soon the other East Asian countries were reporting cases of their own.</p>
      <p>My brother canceled the rest of his trip and flew home early. The talk
        of the town (if it even amounted to that in late January) was the two
        week incubation period and <em>that</em> was enough to get us
        excited. His roommate wasn't taking any chances; he had already fled the
        apartment and moved back in with his parents when my brother came
        home. My brother was hopping mad when he learned his company was only
        allowing him one week to work from home before he had to go back in.</p>
      <p>I was a bit uneasy about the situation myself. I ride public transit
        (train) every day to work and come into contact with lots of people,
        directly and indirectly. With the volume of riders going to and coming
        from San Francisco, someone was bound to have been exposed. On top of
        that there was the regular flu to worry about. I started wearing a mask
        on the train just to convince myself I was doing something about it. A
        few other people on the trains wore masks, but I never saw more than
        three or four in my car.</p>
      <p>In the meantime my relatives in Asia were calling me telling me to
        stock up on masks because they couldn't find any in their stores. For a
        couple of weeks I politely ignored their pleas.</p>
      <p>"Oh it's not so bad. I'll do it this weekend when I find time."</p>
      <p>I never managed to "find time," but when we started seeing fatal cases,
        I began to worry a little. Maybe I don't have enough to last. I should
        try and get some before people start cleaning the shelves. On Saturday,
        February 22, I drove to all the hardware stores and pharmacies in
        town. All the masks were cleared out.</p>

      <h4>The Panic of 2020</h4>
      <p>On February 26, Ash Wednesday in the Liturgical Calendar, California
        confirmed its first case of coronavirus in a Solano County resident who
        hadn't traveled outside the country recently. This confirmed community
        spread, although realistically it had likely been spreading for some time
        already. Given that the Bay Area isn't far from Solano County, we took it
        pretty hard down here.</p>
      <p>The next day I noticed the train being unusually empty on my commute
        home. I distinctly remember having an empty seat next to me on the entire
        leg of my trip. And when I glanced behind me I saw that the entire section
        was empty, save for two other passengers.</p>
      <p>On Friday I drove in to work. Ostensibly I was staying off public
        transit to mitigate exposure, but really I just woke up late that
        morning. In the middle of the morning my brother gave me a call.</p>
      <p>"Elliot, you gotta go shopping today. I went to Costco earlier this
        week and they were cleared out of water bottles and toilet paper!"</p>
      <p>Well then.</p>
      <p>I rushed over to Costco after work and found myself in a
        busier-than-usual warehouse. There were still pallets of water, but they
        were being cleared out fast. The jumbo-sized Charmin' Ultra Soft toilet
        paper was gone. All that was left of the paper products were Kirkland
        brand, and they were being cleared out too.</p>

      <h4>Day Zero</h4>
      <p>It was drizzling as I drove in to work on this Monday morning. Ever
        since Santa Clara County declared its first confirmed case of COVID-19,
        affectionately known as the "coronavirus" among us lay people, or more
        flippantly the "beer flu," I had been driving up to the office. Normally
        I took the train to work, sharing my seat with 400,000 other riders
        across the Bay Area.</p>

        pretend as if I wrote this all on March 16. When I have most of the
        content written out, I will remove this notice. Cheers!</p>
